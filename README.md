IstanbulRouteFinder
===================
This is my Artificial Intelligence Project (Istanbul Technical University).
The project is implemented using .Net 4.0 Framework and BingMaps(MapControl).

Main goal is to implement BFS, DFS and A* algorithms to search routes between two stops.

Notes
-----
-Application reads bus and route informations from .csv files.

-Also “output.txt” is created after a successful search in execution directory.Default it will be “\MapApplication\bin\Release\” directory.
